# Major-Project
Smart Grid Technology Simulation
This is our B.Tech Major Project Made by me and my friends. We have three members in our group. The Objective Of our Project Is To Electrify Rural Areas  Which Provides Better Reliable And Stable Power Supply results into less voltage fluctuation , And To Promote ‘Green Energy’ While Reducing The Dependency On Fossil Fuel Based Power Plant As Well As Reducing The Pollution (Carbon Dioxide Emission).
